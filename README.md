FInal project for the CS 230 Project Software Design Template



**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The new client was The Gaming Room. They wanted to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It. The game is similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The software requirements of the client include the ability to have one or more teams involved, multiple players assigned to each team, unique game and team names, and only one instance of the game can exist in memory at once. The client requires a software design document and game application development, addressing their software requirements.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I think I did a great job with the software design documentation for the Draw It or Lose It game. One of my best ideas was recommending a cloud-based platform to host the game, making it easy for the client to scale the app without having to worry about infrastructure management. I also focused on security, suggesting measures like encryption and access controls to keep user data safe. Overall, I'm proud of what I accomplished and excited to see where the project goes from here.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

From my experience, I found working through a design document to be extremely helpful when developing code. It provides a clear roadmap of what needs to be done, breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable components. This can make the development process less overwhelming and more organized.

Furthermore, a good design document can help to identify potential problems or roadblocks early on in the development process, which can save a lot of time and effort down the line. By outlining the technical requirements, specifications, and other details in advance, the document can help to prevent misunderstandings or miscommunications between different team members. Overall, I believe that working through a design document can help to streamline the development process and lead to a more successful outcome.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would add more specific details and examples about how clients can benefit from the Windows operating system. For example, I would provide details about the user-friendly interface, the wide range of software available for Windows, and the security features that help protect client data. These revisions would make the document more informative and useful to clients who are considering using Windows, while providing more context which option might be the best for them.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

For me taking into consideration the user's needs is critical in designing software that meets their requirements. In my experience, I begin by conducting research to better understand the user's needs, preferences.  I use this information to create user personas and scenarios to guide my design decisions. I also conduct usability testing throughout the development process to validate that the software meets the user's expectations. By focusing on the user's needs I can design software that is intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use. Ultimately, designing with the user in mind leads to higher user satisfaction, increased adoption, and a more successful product overall.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

 I try to keep the user's needs as a priority. I start by analyzing the problem that the software is intended to solve and then consider the potential users and their expectations. I find it helpful to create user personas to represent the different types of people who might use the software. From there, I consider what features and functionality will be necessary to address the users' needs and create a design that is intuitive and easy to use. In the future, I would continue to use these techniques and also keep up with current design trends and technology advancements to improve my software design skills.
